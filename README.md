# Tidyverse workshop
## Fun and Efficient Data Wrangling with R: An Introduction to the Tidyverse. 
### Presented at the University of Idaho Library Workshop series, April 4, 2018.

This repo contains the materials used at a workshop presented through the University of Idaho Library on April 4, 2018. 
If you'd just like to see the slides, check out R/presentation.html (you'll have to download the slides in order to view them).

If you'd like to go through the exercises, follow these instructions: 

1. Download the whole repo. 

2. Unzip the repo. To make things easy, I suggest making a new Rproject in the subdirectory called "R" in the folder you just downloaded. (instructions here: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-Projects)

3. Open and run the script called "install_packages.R" in your Rproject. This script checks to see if you have the packages used in the workshop installed.
If they're not already installed, it installs them. This will take several minutes to run. It's okay if you get warnings saying that the packages were built 
for a certain version of R, though if your R install is really out of date, you might bump into problems (check your version with `sessionInfo()`).

4. Open the script called "workshop_code.R", which is also in the "R" subdirectory. This script has all the code used in the workshop, 
and should approximately match the code used in the "presentation.html" slides. Go through this script to see what was done in the workshop.

Good luck and have fun!
