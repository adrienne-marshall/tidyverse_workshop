## Wrangling data

What do we mean by data wrangling? 

![wrangling](../images/unicorn_wrangling.jpg)

Lots of possible definitions, but generally refers to all the transformations you might need to do to get data into a form that is ready for further analysis. 

## Common tasks

- Create a new column based on calculations in your data

- Select only certain parts of your data

- Do calculations on subsets of your data

- Modify text data

- Iterate over your data

- Merge data from multiple sources 

## Common tasks

- Create a new column based on calculations in your data: `mutate()`

- Select only certain columns or rows of your data: `filter(), select()`

- Do calculations on subsets of your data: `group_by(), summarise()`

- Modify text data: `stringr` functions

- Iterate over your data: `for` loops, `apply()`, `purrr::map()`

- Merge data from multiple sources: `join()`

## Before we start...

## How would you describe your prior experience with R?

1. I just downloaded it for the first time.

2. I use it, but it makes me uncomfortable.

3. I'm comfortable with it, here to learn about the tidyverse. 

## How comfortable are you with programming concepts like for loops and writing functions? 

1. No idea what you're talking about.

2. I've heard of and used these things, but they're a stretch. 

3. Easy peasy. 

## Let's jump in!

- Disclaimer: I don't know everything, and there's always more to learn! 


## The tidyverse

A collection of R packages designed for data wrangling and visualization, built for tidying your data and working with tidy data.

```{r load tidyverse, message = T, warning = F}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Why the tidyverse?

- Elegant, consistent way of organizing data

- First argument to each function is typically a data frame (consistency)

- More like reading English than base R code

- Lots of packages that work well with tidy principles
    + Network graphs, animations, more
    + http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery/
    + https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html
  
- Generally a friendly, enthusiastic community
    + https://community.rstudio.com/t/welcome-to-the-rstudio-community/8

## Why not the tidyverse?

- More likely to change than base R


## Tidy data

1. Each variable forms a column.

2. Each observation forms a row.

3. Each type of observational unit forms a table.
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)

## Tidy data example

An untidy example: 
```{r untidy, echo = F}
df1 <- data.frame(names = c("Adrienne", "Alex"),
                  favorite_food = c("burritos", "pizza"),
                  favorite_color = c("yellow", "turquoise"))
kable(df1)
```

## Tidy data example

Tidied: 

```{r tidy, echo = F, warning = F}
df2 <- reshape2::melt(df1, id.vars = "names")
kable(df2)
```

## Is tidy always better?

![Sometimes messy is good!](../images/messy_face.jpg)

Sometimes messy can be good!

## When not to tidy...

- Data entry

- Data with matrix operations (e.g., statistical modeling)

- Nice to know your options

## Example data

Read data using `read_csv()`.

```{r get data}
ufo <- read_csv("../data/ufo_dat.csv")
ufo1 <- read.csv("../data/ufo_dat.csv")
```

## A word on file structures 

- Many structures work, but you should definitely have one. 

- Consider a "recipe" script. 

- Try to avoid: 
    + `setwd()`
    + `read.csv("adrienne/cool_project1/version6/sdfljk.csv")`

## A word on file structures

![file structure](../images/file_structure.png)

## Let's load some data...

## `read_csv()` / `read.csv()`

- speed difference:

```{r speed test, message = F, warning = F}
system.time(ufo <- read_csv("../data/ufo_dat.csv"))
system.time(ufo1 <- read.csv("../data/ufo_dat.csv"))
```

- `read_csv()` is "lazy and surly" (Wickham).

- `read.csv()`: stringsAsFactors = TRUE, uses rownames

## Take a look

```{r look at data, eval = F}
View(ufo)
```


## The pipe: `%>%`

- Read it in your head as "then"
    + as in, select part of your data, *then* arrange it in order. 

- Use with functions that take a data frame as their first argument. 
    + Works with: `head()`
    + Not with: `mean()`
    
## Common data wrangling tasks

## Rename columns

```{r rename}
ufo <- ufo %>% 
  rename("duration_sec" = `duration (seconds)`)
```

This is the same as: 

```{r rename2, eval = F}
ufo <- rename(ufo, "duration_sec" = `duration (seconds)`)
```


## Create a new column: 
`mutate()`

```{r calculate duration by hour}
ufo <- ufo %>%
  mutate(duration_min = duration_sec/60) %>%
  mutate(duration_hr = duration_min/60)

kable(head(ufo[, c("duration_sec", "duration_min", "duration_hr")]))
```

## Where are the quotes?!

```{r talk about quotes}
ufo <- ufo %>%
  mutate(duration_min = duration_sec/60) %>%
  mutate(duration_hr = duration_min/60)
```

- In tidyverse functions, column names *typically* don't get quotes. 

- This can be a little inconsistent:
    + Check the examples in documentation if unsure: `?mutate`
    + If it becomes a problem, check out tidyeval: https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/articles/programming.html
    
## `mutate()`

Challenge: Add a column that gives the duration in years. 
(Hint: there are 8760 hours in a year.)

## Challenge answer

```{r add years}
ufo <- ufo %>% 
  mutate(duration_years = duration_hr/8760)
```


## Subset your data: 
`filter(), select()`

```{r filter out unreasonably long periods}
ufo %>% 
  filter(duration_hr > 10) %>%
  select(datetime, duration_sec, duration_hr, `duration (hours/min)`) %>%
  arrange(desc(duration_hr)) %>%
  head()
```


---------

31 years?!

```{r filter2}
comment <- ufo %>% 
  filter(duration_sec > 90000000) %>% 
  select(comments)
print(comment$comments)
```


--------

Challenge: Get only the observations shorter than a duration of your choice. Save the results to a new data frame called `short_sight`. 

## Challenge answer

```{r challenge answer2}
short_sight <- ufo %>% filter(duration_hr < 1)
```



## Do calculations on subsets:
`group_by() %>% summarise()`

For example, how many sightings were there per state?

```{r group_by_summarise1}
n_per_state <- ufo %>%
  group_by(state) %>% 
  count(sort = T)
```

---------

```{r group_by_summarise2}
kable(head(n_per_state))
```

## Calculate on subsets
Another example

```{r group_by_summarise3}
mean_lon <- ufo %>% 
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarise(lon = mean(longitude))
```

-------------

```{r group_by_summarise4}
kable(head(mean_lon))
```


## Iterate over your data: 
`for` loops, `apply()`, `purrr::map()`

When to iterate: 

- Anytime you need to do something more than twice (ish)

- Examples: 
    + downloading many files from the internet 
    + analyzing several scenarios
    + calculations for each year in a time series

## `for` loops

- Advantages: many other programming languages also have for loops.

- Disadvantages: can be bulky and/or slow compared to other options.

## Example `for` loops

How many UFOs were observed in each state? 

```{r for loop example}
states <- unique(ufo$state)
answer_df <- data.frame(state = states, n = NA)

for(i in 1:length(states)){
  temporary_data <- ufo %>% filter(state == states[i])
  answer_df$n[i] <- nrow(temporary_data)
}
```

--------

```{r look at answer df}
kable(head(answer_df))
```

Any differences from our `group_by() %>% summarise()` approach?

## Example `apply` function

How many UFOs were observed in each state? 

```{r apply example}
states <- unique(ufo$state)

count_obs <- function(state_id){
  nrow(ufo %>% filter(state == state_id))
}

counts <- lapply(states, count_obs)
```

----------

```{r apply example2}
counts[1:5]
```


## Example `map` function

This is the tidyverse way...

How many UFOs were observed in each state? 

```{r map example}
states <- unique(ufo$state)

count_obs <- function(state_id){
  nrow(ufo %>% filter(state == state_id))
}

ans_list <- map(states, count_obs)
ans_vect <- map_int(states, count_obs)
```

## More with `map`

```{r map example2}
head(mtcars)
models <- mtcars %>% 
  split(.$cyl) %>% 
  map(function(df) lm(mpg ~ wt, data = df))
```

** Example stolen directly from R for Data Science: http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#the-map-functions

## What did we get?

A list of three linear models...

```{r map example 3a}
str(models, max.level = 1)
```


## What did we get? 

```{r map example3b}
summary(models[[1]])
```

## Extract coefficients

```{r map example4}
names(models[[1]])
```

## Extract coeffients

```{r map example5}
map(models, "coefficients")
```


** Caveat: May not be a good idea statistically...

## Merge data from multiple sources: `join()`

Are number of UFO sightings per year associated with economic conditions? 

## `join()`

First, get economic data: `?economics`

```{r get sunspots}
kable(head(economics))
```

## `join()`

Make a year column in the UFO dataset. This requires a brief detour into `lubridate`

```{r ufo get year, warning = F, message = F}
library(lubridate)

ufo <- ufo %>% 
  separate(datetime, into = c("date", "time"), sep = " ") %>%
  mutate(date = mdy(date)) %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date))
```


## `join()`

Let's see what we got out of that: 

```{r look at data frame. }
ufo %>% 
  select(date, time, year) %>% 
  head() %>% 
  kable()
```

## `join()`

We'll need to know how many UFO sightings there were each year in our dataset. 

Challenge: how would you do this?

- Consider:
    + `for` loops
    + `apply` functions
    + `map` functions
    + `group_by() %>% summarise()`

## `join()`

```{r ufo summary}
ufo_counts <- ufo %>% 
  group_by(year) %>%
  count()

kable(head(ufo_counts))
```

## `join()`

We'll also want economic summaries by year. 

```{r econ summary}
econ_summary <- economics %>% 
  mutate(year = year(date)) %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  select(-date)
```


## At last: `join()`

```{r join}
df_new <- left_join(ufo_counts, econ_summary, by = "year") %>% 
  filter(year >= min(econ_summary$year)) 
kable(head(df_new))
```

## Why join?

```{r join2, echo = F}
ggplot(df_new, aes(x = unemploy, y = n)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## How do joins work?

![joins](../images/join-venn.png)

## Wide to long: `melt`

What if we wanted to plot all these economic variables at the same time?

## Wide to long: `melt`

```{r melt, warning = F, message = F}
library(reshape2)
df_long <- df_new %>% 
  melt(id.vars = c("year", "n"))

kable(head(df_long))

```

## Wide to long: `melt`

```{r melt2, message = F}
ggplot(df_long, aes(x = value, y = n)) + 
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth() + 
  facet_wrap(~variable, scales = "free_x")
```


## Text data: `stringr` functions

Which UFO observations refer to a color? 

```{r ufo colors}
ufo <- ufo %>% mutate(comments = tolower(comments))

colors <- c(" red ", " orange ", " yellow ", " green ", " blue ", " purple ", " pink ", " white ", " black ")

ufo_colors <- ufo %>% 
  mutate(color_ans = str_detect(comments, paste(colors, collapse = "|"))) %>% 
  filter(color_ans == T)
```

Why the spaces? Any potential problems with spaces?

## Look at some comments

```{r ufo colors 2}
ufo_colors$comments[1:10]
```

## Extract the colors

```{r ufo colors 3}
colors_ans <- map(colors, function(color){str_extract(ufo_colors$comments, color)})

colors_df <- as.data.frame(colors_ans) 
colors_df <- colors_df %>%
  unite("colors_included", 1:ncol(colors_df), sep = ";") %>%
  mutate(colors_included = str_replace_all(colors_included, "NA;", "")) %>%
  mutate(colors_included = str_replace_all(colors_included, ";NA", ""))

head(colors_df)

```

## Add colors to original data

```{r ufo colors 4}
ufo_colors <- ufo_colors %>% mutate(colors = colors_df$colors_included)

```

## Working with text data

"You never get better at regex; you just get better at googling." 

http://stringr.tidyverse.org

https://www.tidytextmining.com/

## Put it together to answer a question

What colors are most common in UFOs, and is there a relationship between color and shape? 

```{r most common colors}
library(tidytext)
colors_df <- ufo_colors %>% 
  unnest_tokens(output = colors, input = colors, 
                token = stringr::str_split, pattern = ";") %>%
  mutate(colors = str_replace_all(colors, " ", ""))

```

--------------

```{r most common colors2}
colors_df %>% 
  select(date, colors) %>%
  head() %>% 
  kable()

```


## Most common UFO colors

```{r most common colors3}
colors_df %>% 
  group_by(colors) %>% 
  count(sort = T) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = colors, y = n)) + 
  geom_col() + 
  coord_flip()

```

## Looks like white UFOs are the most common 
but red and orange show up a lot too!

## Is there a relationship between color and shape? 

First, we should just get the 5 most common shapes.

Challenge: How would you do that? 

## Most common shapes

```{r common shapes}
shapes <- colors_df %>% 
  filter(!is.na(shape)) %>%
  group_by(shape) %>%
  count(sort = TRUE) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  slice(1:5)

kable(shapes)
```

What's wrong with this?

## Keep only data with shapes in the top 5.

Challenge: How would you do that? 

## Keep only data with shapes in the top 5.

```{r keep common shapes}
shape_colors <- colors_df %>%
  filter(shape %in% shapes$shape)
```

## Relationship between shape and color: 

```{r shape color}
ggplot(shape_colors, aes(x = colors, fill = shape)) + 
  geom_bar(position = "fill")
```

## If extra time... 

- What's another question we could ask of this data?

- What are the programming steps we would need to answer it? 

## Review

What do each of these functions do? 

- `mutate()`

- `filter()`

- `select()`

- `group_by() %>% summarise()`

- `str_select()` or `str_extract()`

- `join()`

## Review: iteration

What are some approaches to iteration? 

- `for` loops

- `apply()` functions

- `map()` functions 

- in simple cases, may be replacable with `group_by() %>% summarise()`
